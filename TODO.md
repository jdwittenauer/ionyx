# TODO

This project is extremely early in development.  Below is a summary of tasks required before the first alpha release.

- implement a high-level "experiment" class to tie everything together (design still needs fleshed out)
- add unit tests for each class/function
- add example code using the sample data sets
- add more error checking and in-line comments
- update code base to use scikit-learn cross-validation, pipelines etc.
- update code bade to use scikit-learn wrapper classes for keras, xgboost etc.
- update code base to use scikit-learn's new stacking ensemble class
